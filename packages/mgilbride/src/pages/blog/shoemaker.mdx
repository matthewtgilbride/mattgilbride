I built this site because I'm a software developer, and like many software developers,
I do a lot of work on web applications.  Unfortunately, many (but not all) engineers don't
have a website of their own.  That used to be me.

We build web apps with Single Page Application (SPA) frameworks these days.  Then, we use
static site generators to turn them into multi-page, static websites.  Well isn't that lovely.  While I do think the SPA 
approach is an improvement over the architectures that preceded it, 
count me amongst the many that think it's reign as the de-facto way to build web apps won't last forever.
In any case, this being 2020, I've chosen to build this thing using the the tools du jour, and that
includes the following:

- Typescript
- React
- Emotion and react-spring
- Gatsby

Let's talk about each of those.

## Typescript

Of the five items listed above, Typescript is the most important to me.  So, this section is going to be the longest.
I think Typescript has the most potential to endure for decades, as opposed to years.
The Javascript ecosystem is notoriously fickle.  Today, in 2020,
React feels like the gold standard of web development tooling.  It's easy to forget that it was released in 2013.  That was 7 years ago...an eon in Javascript time...but not very long in the grand scheme of things.

What few people realize is that Typescript is actually older than React. It was open sourced in 2012.  
Contrary to React, which surged in popularity in 2015 when large companies like Netflix and AirBnb adopted it,
the Typescript hype train didn't depart until recently.  But now that the train has left the station, 
it's accelerating rapidly.

The static vs. dynamic type checking dichotomy is about as old as computer programming itself.
LISP, widely accepted as the first dynamically typed language, was created in 1959.
That's just two years after FORTRAN, possibly the oldest language still in use today.
And Typescript is far from the first attempt to bring static type checking to web programming.
Coffeescript, Elm, Dart, and Scala.js are just a few of many alternatives for those wishing to write statically checked
code that transpiles to javascript, and thus can run in the browser.

Two things make Typescript different.  I'm not sure which is more important.

#### Syntax

The first is that Typescript "start's from the same syntax and semantics that millions of javascript developers know today"
and "compiles to clean, simple javascript".  That means that both Typescript source code and the code emitted
by the compiler can be easily understood by anyone who knows Javascript.  Javascript is already assuming
a larger and larger role in every website, by virtue of the SPA approach I mentioned before.  In 2020,
front-end developers are Javascript developers.  When it comes to adoption by the existing community of 
developers targeting browsers, being as close to plain Javascript as possible gives
Typescript a distinct advantage over the languages mentioned above.

#### Flexiblity

The second is Typescript's approach to static type checking.  Typescript is a gradual type system, which
means that some variables and expressions can be statically checked at compile time, while others are left
untyped and checked at runtime.  Type checkers are supposed to help engineers, not hinder them.  Typescript's
checker can be told to "go away" when it's user can't wrangle the type system to their liking.  That is not
the case in most other languages.  Python, from version 3.5 and later, supports a similar approach entitled
type hints.  It has a much lower barrier to entry, since there is no transpilation step.  One can choose to 
write type hints or not.  The Python interpreter ignores the extra syntax, and separate tooling can be stood 
up to do the type checking.
Python, however, doesn't run in a browser (yet).  So for now, those of us developing web front ends have to
make other choices.

I could say more about Typescript.
The decisions that team has made with regards to soundness and completeness, as well as
structural vs. nominal typing, are fascinating.  In the end, however, the point is
that we all want to maximize productivity and minimize bugs.  Typescript helps, and that's all that matters.

## React

For many, React is considered the top framework for front-end development in 2020.
Angular and Vue lurk close behind, with Vue gaining momentum quickly.  React is my favorite,
and also the one that I have the most experience with, so it was a simple choice to use it for this project.

I've never done anything substantial in Angular, though I have dabbled in a few very small
applications.  I have had the opportunity to do substantial development in Vue over the last year.
In fact, a post entitled "10 things I like and don't like about Vue" is high on my list of things
to write about in the immediate future.  Vue 3 might change things a lot. It's written in Typescript, supports JSX,
and has a composition API similar to that of hooks. So, take the next few points with a grain of salt.

#### JSX

The main point of distinction I see with React is it's approach to templating, or lack thereof.
JSX was controversial when React first gained notoriety.  In fact, it was my main point of hesitation when I started.  Angular 
and Vue both use template engines to add Javascript "directives" to HTML.  JSX is the opposite.  It extends Javascript 
with syntax that looks like HTML.  In short, templates add Javascript to HTML,
JSX adds HTML to Javascript.  The template approach in Angular and Vue is actually quite similar to the template
approach of the MVC frameworks that preceded SPA's.  Before I wrote Javascript apps, I worked on large
enterprise web apps written in Java.  The frustrations I encountered with Java Servlet Pages
(JSP's) are the same as the ones I have with Vue and Angular templates.  JSP's, in short, add Java to
HTML.  With all templating engines, the issues are the same:

- It's not obvious what variables are in scope, and thus can be referenced in a template.
- When things go wrong, template problems can be very hard to debug.  Error messages typically come
from the template engine itself, and thus can't be as accurate as messages thrown in user code.

JSX eliminates these issues. For those reasons, I personally find JSX to be a refreshingly unique take on
a problem almost as old as the web itself.

#### APIs

Hooks and Context API...

## Emotion and react-spring

Yes, I am a fan of CSS-in-JS.  We are already writing Typescript, which transpiles to Javascript
(but also JSX, which compiles to Javascript), which then transpiles to more Javascript, which emits DOM.
We live in a crazy world, so we might as well write Javascript that emits CSS as well because, well, who
the hell cares at this point anyway?  The thing I like about CSS-in-JS is that is can also be CSS-in-TS,
which can be statically checked at compile time.  See my rant on Typescript above. 

Throughout this project's source I use Emotions support for writing CSS styles as Javascript objects
instead of string interpolations for exactly the same reason.  I can leverage the great CSSType
project to ensure that I'm using the right values for the right properties, and that is great
for someone like me, who is far from a CSS expert.   

I shouldn't say too much more in this blog post, however.  If you want to hear more of my opinions
on this subject you can check out my talk at Philly ETE 2020 with the guy who taught me everything
I know about styling (here).

## Gatsby

Frankly, I don't have much to say about Gatsby at this point.  The community support seems great,
it seems mature enough, and things are working so far.  I'll just harken back to my previous point,
however.  I know I'm not alone in my suspicions of the fact that in 2020 we are writing SPA's in
Javascript frameworks just to turn around and generate static sites out of them.  Call me crazy...

...and this is in no way critical of the creators and maintainers of the Gatsby project.  From what I
can tell it's a great project and a great community.
